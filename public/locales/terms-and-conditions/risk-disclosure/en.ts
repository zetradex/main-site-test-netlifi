    "When executing trading operations under margin trading conditions, even a small market movement may have a great impact on client’s trading account due to the effect of leverage (or ‘gearing’ as it is also referred to). This means that a relatively small market change may lead to a proportionately much larger change in the value of client’s position either favourably or unfavourably. Greater leverage involves greater risk. The size of leverage therefore partly determines the result of the investment.",

These OTC transactions could involve greater risk than investing in on-exchange derivatives as there is no exchange market on which to close out an open position.
