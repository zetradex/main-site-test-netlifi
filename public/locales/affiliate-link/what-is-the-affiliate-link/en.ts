    "This is a code unique to every partner, which comprises the end of all URLs you would be using to redirect possible clients to the Zetradex main website. Our servers use these affiliate links to record the clients you successfully attract to Zetradex - all customers who open live accounts and make at least one deposit after using your unique link are your referrals. The cookies that go with each affiliate code last up to 12 months, which means that if someone decides to open an account a year after they have used your code, they will still become a part of your affiliate group.",
