  aPip: "A pip in forex is usually a one-digit movement in the fourth decimal place of a currency pair. So, if EUR/USD moves from $1.35361 to $1.35371, then it has moved a single pip. But, if youâ€™re trading JPY crosses, a pip is a change at the second decimal place. A price movement at the fifth decimal place in forex trading is known as a pipette.",
  WhatIsLot: "What is lot?",
  Currencies:
    "Currencies are traded in lots, which are batches of currency used to standardise forex trades. As forex price movements are usually small, lots tend to be very large. For example, a standard lot is 100,000 units of the base currency.",
