    "Metals were some of the first objects exchanged and traded in history. Today, similar to the early days, the most common metals traded are gold (XAU) and silver (XAG). The gold market is more liquid because it is more exposed to economic and financial fundamentals.",
  AnotherSignificant:
    "Another significant advantage in favor of gold for traders is its high level of correlation with major currencies, such as the US dollar or euro. For example, when the dollar strengthens, gold comes under pressure and its price begins to decline.",
