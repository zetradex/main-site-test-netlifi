  Unlike:
    "Unlike the Forex market, securities trading is considered more predictable. Each financial instrument in the securities market is backed by a specific company or group of companies, allowing for the consideration of both macro and microeconomic indicators.",
  So: "So, how much can you earn from stocks?",
  ForExample:
    "For example, in February 2017, Apple shares were trading at around $35 per share. In 2022, Apple topped the list of the most valuable global brands by Brand Finance, with a value of £355 billion. As of the beginning of 2022, the company's market capitalisation exceeded £3 trillion.",
  InJanuary:
    "In January, 2022, the price of one Apple share was $166.1. If you had purchased, let's say, 10 shares of the company in 2017, spending $350 on them, they would have been worth $1661 after 5 years and would have brought you a profit of $1311.",
